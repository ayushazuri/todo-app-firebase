# Key Points 📋
- This web app comes with various features. It is mainly built with `React`, `SASS`, and `Firestore` from `Firebase` for database.
- Add a Title and it's content in the input boxes. It will be added to the tasks to do section. This will make a `todos` collection in firestore, and the corresponding tasks details such as `id` `title` `content` and `timestamp` will be added to the firestore.
- When the task is complete, Click on the `Completed` button. Now two actions will occur. 
  - A new collection `completed` will be created in the firestore, if not present already, and the completed task will be added in this collection.
  - Now that particular task will be deleted from the `todos` collection in the firestore, as it has been completed now. 
- You can also sort the task, ascending or descending, with respect to the timestamp present in the data that was added to the collection previously. Choose `asc` or `desc` and the cards will be sorted accordingly.
- All the data are being fetched or added in real time by the firestore.
- Deployement has also been done by `Firebase`.
